# Get Started
WebShrine Stdlib is a powerful library that provides a wide range of functions, types etc., following most used practices

## Introduction
**Goals:**
- To be a modern replacement for legacy libraries such as lodash
- Focus on performance, but without sacrificing Developer Experience
- Systematization of functions, types and [terminology](/terms) from different practices
- Simple examples based on real cases to quickly understand the benefits
- Low entry threshold, by reusing terms from well-known libraries and [migration guides](/migration)

## Installation

### Common usage
```bash
npm i @webshrine/stdlib // [!=npm auto]
```

### Only types usage
```bash
npm i -D @webshrine/stdtyp // [!=npm auto]
```
